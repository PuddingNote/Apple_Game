# Google Play In-App Updates Plugin for Unity

## Overview

Google Play Plugins for Unity provide C# APIs for accessing Play in-game features from within the Unity Engine. These plugins also provide Unity Editor features for building a game before publishing it on Google Play.  

Play In-App Updates lets you prompt users to update to the latest version of your game, when a new version is available, without the user needing to visit the Play Store.

Refer to the [documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-updates/unity) and [Runtime API reference](https://developer.android.com/reference/unity/namespace/Google/Play/AppUpdate) for more information.
